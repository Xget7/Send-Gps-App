# Send-Gps-App

This app have a Clean Architecture to login and register , don't have the best UI but I make a lot of effort to finish him.

Simple , you loggin in , you select your emergency contanct and you're ready to travel to any place with peace , if you don't open the app and don't confirm you still ok the app
automaticlly send a SMS to your emergency contact selected  with your coordinates in a Google Maps link.

It still has some errors that I have not been able to solve but at least it is functional and to be my second application I would say that it is not so bad.
